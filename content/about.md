# About PEJSAM

PEJSAM represents the collaboration between two IT professionals who share a passion for improving how software teams work together. Through creative presentations, keynotes, and workshops, we explore the intersection of development and quality, helping builders and breakers collaborate more effectively.

## Our Approach

We believe that technical topics can be presented in engaging and memorable ways. By combining professional expertise with creative formats - including theatrical presentations and interactive workshops - we help teams understand complex collaboration challenges through fresh perspectives.

Our work focuses on real-world challenges that software teams face: communication barriers between developers and testers, the human aspects of automation, and the importance of flow and context in collaborative work.
