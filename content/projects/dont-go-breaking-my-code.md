**Location:** Room F1+F2+F3 - Plenary
**Type:** 45-minute Keynote

## Overview

A theatrical keynote that uses dramatic performance and humor to explore the dynamics between developers and testers. Through a cinematic technicolor metaphor, the presentation illustrates how teamwork builds complete understanding through layered perspectives.

## The Performance

The keynote employs theatrical dialogue between a tester and developer:
- The tester reports bugs involving emoji crashes
- The developer dismisses these as unrealistic edge cases
- This dramatic exchange explores workplace friction and miscommunication
- Demonstrates how different professional roles can struggle to align despite shared objectives

## Key Takeaways

### Flow and Context-Switching
Understanding how interruptions and context-switching disrupt productivity and impact team efficiency.

### Managing Mental Load
Collaboration requires being aware of and managing mental load for all parties involved in the software development process.

### Timing in Collaboration
Knowing when to critique versus when to encourage - the importance of timing in team interactions.

### Multiple Perspectives
Without all viewpoints represented, the full picture remains incomplete. Like layers in technicolor film, each perspective adds essential depth to understanding.

## Theme

The presentation emphasizes that complete understanding in software development requires multiple perspectives working together. Just as technicolor requires multiple layers to create the full picture, effective software development requires both building and breaking perspectives to achieve quality.

## Audience

Relevant for everyone in software development (with a sense of humour) - developers, testers, managers, and anyone involved in software team collaboration.

## Availability

The keynote was available via Virtual Pass for remote attendees.
