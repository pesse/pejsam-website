# Non-atomic Operations of Builders and Breakers

**Event:** QA&TEST Conference (Embedded QA TEST)
**Speakers:** Lena Nyström & Samuel Nitsche
**Type:** Presentation/Talk

## Overview

This presentation addresses the collaboration challenges between testers (breakers) and developers (builders) in software teams, exploring how these two essential roles can work together more effectively.

## Key Focus Areas

### Builder-Breaker Dynamics
Understanding the different perspectives and goals of developers who build features versus testers who find issues, and how these roles complement each other.

### Collaboration Challenges
Identifying common friction points in developer-tester collaboration:
- Communication barriers
- Different working rhythms and priorities
- Misaligned incentives
- Timing and workflow integration

### Non-atomic Operations
Exploring how software development tasks are rarely isolated operations - they require coordination, context-sharing, and collaboration between multiple roles and perspectives.
